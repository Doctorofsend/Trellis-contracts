//! Soroban budget regression suite for the treasury contract's critical paths
//! (issue #158).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `GAS_OPTIMIZATION.md` documents an optimization checklist and a set of
//! `gas_bench_*` tests, but those tests only assert *behaviour*: that the cheap
//! validations are ordered correctly, that an accumulator converges. None of
//! them pins the *cost*. Nothing in the repository failed when a change made a
//! treasury path more expensive, and the guide claimed that "Soroban's test host
//! doesn't expose raw CU counts" — which is not true: `Env::budget()` exposes the
//! host's own CPU-instruction and memory meters, which are the same quantities
//! the network charges for.
//!
//! This module turns those meters into assertions.
//!
//! # What is measured
//!
//! Every critical entry point is measured on three shapes:
//!
//! | Shape | Meaning |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | common | The typical call, with resources already set up. |
//! | worst-case supported | The heaviest *accepted* call: the largest amount the guards allow, with the optional quota configured so the whole path runs. |
//! | rejected over-limit | The call the guards must turn away, which an attacker can force for free. |
//!
//! # Thresholds
//!
//! Thresholds live in the `LIMITS` block below, one constant per measurement,
//! and are compared against the measurement with a small percentage of
//! headroom so that a `soroban-sdk` patch bump does not fail the build for no
//! reason. The host's cost model is deterministic for a fixed SDK version and a
//! fixed sequence of operations, so a real regression is reproducible.
//!
//! When a threshold is exceeded, the failure message names the constant to
//! raise. Raising it is a deliberate act: see the "Budget Regression Thresholds"
//! section of `GAS_OPTIMIZATION.md` for the update process.
//!
//! # Fixture notes
//!
//! Two things about the contract shape this suite has to work around, both
//! recorded here because they cost time to rediscover:
//!
//! * `deposit` calls `token::Client::transfer`, so the fixture token must be a
//!   real stellar-asset contract. A bare `Address::generate` aborts it with a
//!   host error, and with it every other measured path: the withdrawals start
//!   from a category balance that only a successful `deposit` can create.
//! * `set_referral_contract` calls `admin.require_auth()` twice in one
//!   invocation (once via `require_admin`, once via `grant_role`), which the
//!   host's recording-auth mode (`Env::mock_all_auths`) rejects with
//!   `Error(Auth, ExistingValue)`. [`register_referral`] therefore writes the
//!   same two storage entries directly, so the `distribute_reward` path can be
//!   measured at all.
//!
//! # Scope note
//!
//! The harness is local to this crate because a shared home would need a new
//! `test-support` feature on the `shared` crate, i.e. a manifest change. If a
//! second contract grows a budget suite, lift [`measure`] and [`BudgetLimit`]
//! into that feature and delete this copy.
