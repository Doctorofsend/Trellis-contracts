//! Deterministic ledger-sequence harness controls (Issue #156).
//!
//! Soroban tests must be reproducible: no wall clock, no OS entropy, and an
//! explicit ledger for every boundary a test asserts on. The ledger helpers in
//! `shared`'s sibling crate (`testing::helpers`) cover the mechanics, but the
//! `testing` crate does not build on `main` (pre-existing breakage in
//! `mocks.rs`, `fuzzing.rs`, `simulation.rs` and `examples.rs`, tracked
//! separately), so the boundary logic that lives **in this crate** gets its
//! own test-only control here.
//!
//! [`LedgerSequenceHarness`] adds the two things a raw
//! `env.ledger().set_sequence_number(..)` call does not give a test:
//!
//! 1. a **deterministic timestamp** derived from the sequence
//!    ([`SECONDS_PER_LEDGER`] per ledger), so time never comes from the host
//!    clock, and
//! 2. **ordering**: the harness tracks the highest ledger it has consumed, so
//!    a caller cannot silently move the clock backwards and a submission
//!    stamped behind that high-water mark is reported as
//!    [`LedgerOrder::OutOfOrder`] instead of being replayed.
//!
//! ## Ledger assumptions this harness pins
//!
//! | Rule | Code | Boundary |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | An escrow's `expiry_ledger` must be strictly after the current ledger | [`crate::payments::create_escrow`] | `expiry == current` → `Error::InvalidArgument` |
//! | An escrow can be released **at** its expiry ledger | [`crate::payments::release_escrow`] | `current == expiry` → released, `current == expiry + 1` → `Error::PaymentEscrowExpired` |
//! | Aid settles at or before expiry, refunds strictly after it | [`crate::lifecycle::AidStateMachine`] | `current == expiry` → settle `Ok` / refund `Err`, `current == expiry + 1` → settle `Err` / refund `Ok` |
//! | A future expiry must sit inside the configured window | [`crate::semantic::validate_future_expiry`] | `expiry < current + min_delay_ledgers` → `Error::InvalidArgument` |
//! | A queued job never moves earlier, and re-submitting it never rewrites the schedule | [`crate::jobs::enqueue_job`] | duplicate submission → `EnqueueOutcome::AlreadyPending` with the original `due_ledger` |
//! | A completed request is replayed, not repeated | [`crate::idempotency::begin`] | second `begin` → the stored completed record; a different `request_hash` → `IdempotencyError::ConflictingRequest` |
//!
//! The scenario tests live in [`crate::test_ledger_sequence`] and cover the
//! four acceptance-criteria cases: same-ledger, next-ledger, expired-ledger
//! and out-of-order. See `docs/LEDGER_ASSUMPTIONS.md` for the
//! contributor-facing version of this table.
